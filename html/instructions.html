        <h3>How to master Mastermind?</h3>
        <p>
            Each guess is made by placing a row of code pegs on the decoding board.
            <br> Once placed, the codemaker provides feedback by placing from zero to four key pegs in the small holes
            of the
            row with the guess.
            <br> A white key peg is placed for each code peg from the guess which is correct in both color and position,
            <br> and a black key pge is placed for each code peg from the guess which is a correct color, but in wrong
            position.
            <br> The game is set defaultively to an option of six colors to choose from, and 4 circles to have to fill
            correctly.
            <br> To play like that click the "to play" button, to change click the "to change" button.
